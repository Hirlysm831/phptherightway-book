# Community {#community_title}

The PHP community is as diverse as it is large, and its members are ready and willing to support new PHP programmers.
Consider joining your local PHP user group (PUG) or attending larger PHP conferences to learn more about the best
practices shown here. You can hang out on IRC in the #phpc channel on [irc.freenode.com][php-irc] and follow the
[@phpc][phpc-twitter] twitter account. Get out there, meet new developers, learn new topics, and above all, make new
friends! Other community resources include the Google+ PHP [Programmer community][php-programmers-gplus] and
[StackOverflow][php-so].

## PHP User Groups {#user_groups_title}

If you live in a larger city, odds are there's a PHP user group nearby. You can easily find your local PUG at
the [usergroup-list at php.net][php-uglist] which is based upon [PHP.ug][php-ug]. Alternate sources might be
[Meetup.com][meetup] or a search for ```php user group near me``` using your favorite search engine
(i.e. [Google][google]). If you live in a smaller town, there may not be a local PUG; if that's the case, start one!

Special mention should be made of two global user groups: [NomadPHP] and [PHPWomen]. [NomadPHP] offers twice monthly
online user group meetings with presentations by some of the top speakers in the PHP community.
[PHPWomen] is a non-exclusive user group originally targeted towards the women in the PHP world. Membership is open to
everyone who supports a more diverse community. PHPWomen provide a network for support, mentorship and education, and
generally promote the creating of a "female friendly" and professional atmosphere.

members of the PHP community usually speak at these larger events, so it's a great opportunity to learn directly from
industry leaders.

It was originally designed for the PHP project in 1998 by [Vincent Pontier][vincent-pontier] - spiritual father of thousands of elePHPants around the world and 10 years later adorable plush elephant toy came to birth as well. Now elePHPants are present at many PHP conferences and with many PHP developers at their computers for fun and inspiration.
